PbStockResearcher
=================

A tool to make researching stocks faster. This is NOT meant to substitute human effort, just reduce it. 

I personally find existing tools to be very useful, but don't fit me very well anymore. I figure that existing tools
must get there data from somewhere. That somewhere is probably the SEC which makes all filings public.

The initial milestone for this project will be:
- Parse out XBRL files from the SEC full indexes
- Parse out basic financial information for companies from the XBRL files (revenue, income, assets, etc)

Eventual goals for this project (incomplete list):
- Custom stock screeners
- Recommendation engine for stocks to investigate. This is NOT an algorithm for automatic trading. You don't watch everything Netflix recommends right? It is a nice place to start though to find something interesting.
- Custom dashboards for portfolios
- Alerts for actions such as SEC investigations
- Track previous companies key executives have run and evaluate those with the current company performance.
